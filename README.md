# Hi, Iâ€™m Ahsan ðŸ‘‹

I build software that shipsâ€”MVPs, SaaS, and systems that hold up in production.  
Backend first (Laravel, PHP, Python, Node.js). Frontend when it matters (Vue, React, Inertia).  
Right now: reviewing and refining AI training content as a **Code Reviewer @ SuperAnnotate (contract)**.

### What Iâ€™m good at
- **Turning ideas into MVPs** that launch fast and evolve cleanly
- **Designing backends & APIs** that stay reliable under real traffic
- **Owning delivery** end-to-end: scoping â†’ building â†’ launching â†’ iterating

### Highlights
- **Rebuilt Shorages from scratch** â†’ storage/logistics platform used by real businesses  
- **Created Lamia from scratch** â†’ multichannel product-listing system connecting Amazon, Shopify, eBay, Etsy + payments (Stripe)  
- **Lead developer** on client projects â†’ met with stakeholders, gathered requirements, shipped to spec and on time

### Current work
- **SuperAnnotate (ongoing)** â€” review prompts/responses, evaluate model outputs, give structured feedback, and help keep quality consistent across projects
